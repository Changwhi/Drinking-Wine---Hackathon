# Drinking-Wine---Hackathon  
Link: https://devpost.com/software/dwine/edit  
Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHdCtpWrdeQ

## Inspiration  
Inspired by the challenging tech industry where students and or people who may be unemployed that need more practice with tech company interview questions.
## What it does  
Provides 1:1 mock interview through a chat interface
## How we built it  
Learning new frameworks on the fly and applying them as quickly as possible
## Challenges we ran into  
Adapting to frameworks and work together as a team
## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
Being able to make the front end look amazing and to be able to tie this together with the back-end
## What we learned  
How to reorient ourselves when the team zoned in too much on one feature
## What's next for Dwine  
More features down the line, one feature would be pertaining to chat log system
